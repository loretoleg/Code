# Code

This project consists of 3 parts: 

1) The GUI: Using tkinter for a user interactive interface, the code will prompt the user to open a database excel file, then choose 2 options of combustible, then add which number to make the report on then finally a name for the output excel file.
2) The data interaction: Pandas was used to extract data, filter and interact with the data, then load the relevant data into the report.
3) The report excel: Using openpyxl package, the formating on the template and the merging of the data with the template was done here. Finally the report creation was also achieved using this package.
